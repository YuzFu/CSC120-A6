- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance largely simplifies the process of coding. All I need is to modify/add attributes and methods that I need for specific class.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At this point, I am getting used to coding in java. However, I realize that I have some frequent errors, for example, I tend to create too many variables and make methods complicated.
